% Testing

Alright, so we've got `push` and `pop` written, now we can actually test out
our stack! Rust and cargo support testing as a first-class feature, so this
will be super easy. All we have to do is write function, and annotate it with
`#[test]`.

Generally, we try to keep our tests next to the code that its testing in the
Rust community. However we usually make a new namespace for the tests, to
avoid conflicting with the "real" code. Just as we used `mod` to specify that
`first.rs` should be included in `lib.rs`, we can use `mod` to basically
create a whole new file *inline*:


```rust
// in first.rs

mod test {
    #[test]
    fn basics() {
        // TODO
    }
}
```

And we invoke it with `cargo test`.

```text

   Compiling lists v0.1.0 (file:///Users/ABeingessner/dev/too-many-lists/lists)
     Running target/debug/lists-5c71138492ad4b4a

running 1 test
test first::test::basics ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests lists

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Yay our do-nothing test passed! Let's make it not-do-nothing. We'll do that
with the `assert_eq!` macro. This isn't some special testing magic. All it
does is compare the two things you give it, and panic the program if they don't
match. Yep, you inidicate failure to the test harness by freaking out!

```rust
mod test {
    #[test]
    fn basics() {
        let mut list = List::new();

        // Check empty list behaves right
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), None);

        // Populate list
        list.push(1);
        list.push(2);
        list.push(3);

        // Check normal removal
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(3));
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(2));

        // Push some more just to make sure nothing's corrupted
        list.push(4);
        list.push(5);

        // Check normal removal
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(5));
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(4));

        // Check exhaustion
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(1));
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), None);
    }
}
```

Oops! Because we made a new module, we need to pull in List explicitly to use
it.

```rust
mod test {
    use super::List;
    // everything else the same
}
```

Yay!

What's up with that warning though...? We clearly use List in our test!

...but only when testing! To appease the compiler (and to be friendly to our
consumers), we should indicate that the whole `test` module should only be
compiled if we're running tests.


```
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::List;
    // everything else the same
}
```

And that's everything for testing!
