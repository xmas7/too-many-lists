% Peek

One thing we didn't even bother to implement was peeking. Let's go ahead
and do that. All we need to do is return a reference to the element in
the head of the list, if it exists. Sounds easy, let's try:

```
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    self.head.map(|node| {
        &node.elem
    })
}
```

*Sigh*. What now, Rust?

Map takes `self` by value, which would move the Option out of the thing it's in.
Previously this was fine because we had just `take`n it out, but now we actually
want to leave it where it was. The *correct* way to handle this is with the
`as_ref` method on Option, which has the following definition:

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> Option<&T>;
}
```

It demotes the Option<T> to an Option to a reference to its internals. We could
do this ourselves with an explicit match but *ugh no*. It does mean that we
need to do an extra derefence to cut through the extra indirection, but
thankfully the `.` operator handles that for us.


```rust
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    self.head.as_ref().map(|node| {
        &node.elem
    })
}
```

Nailed it.

We can also make a *mutable* version of this method using `as_mut`:

```rust
pub fn peek_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T> {
    self.head.as_mut().map(|node| {
        &mut node.elem
    })
}
```
